| **Problem**             | A customer's request for complex permissions, initially estimated at six weeks, revealed an underlying issue: files were being archived without user awareness, affecting all users.    |
| **Solution**            | Instead of proceeding with the complex permissions, a more efficient approach was adopted. A warning system was implemented to inform users about the consequences of file archival, addressing the root problem and mitigating the need for a lengthy six-week project. |
| **Impact**              | The implemented solution resulted in a one-day change, significantly reducing the time and resources required. Users were now informed about archival impacts, enhancing awareness and avoiding the need for a complex permissions system. This approach optimized the resolution process and showcased the value of exploring alternative solutions. |
