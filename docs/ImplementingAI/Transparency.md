# Privacy Standards and Transparency in Algorithmic Decision-Making

## 1. **Introduction**
   - Brief overview of privacy standards (e.g., FIPP, ISO29100) and their focus on privacy notices, user data access, and notification of changes.
   - Introduction to GDPR's Article 22, addressing algorithmic decision-making and specific rights for individuals.

## 2. **GDPR's Article 22**
   - Rights granted to individuals under specific conditions, including human intervention, contesting decisions, and access to meaningful information about the decision logic.
   - Reference to the US Equal Credit Opportunity Act's requirement for detailed explanations on credit denial decisions made by algorithms.

## 3. **Transparency for End-Users and Stakeholders**
   - Importance of transparency not only for end-users but also for internal stakeholders.
   
## 4. **Internal Stakeholders' Understanding**
   - **Proper Model Documentation:**
      - Key elements: model type, intent, proposed features, feature importance, potential harm, and bias.
   - **Dataset Transparency:**
      - Elements to consider: source, lawful basis, data type, cleaning status, and age.
      - Reference to Data Cards as a popular industry approach (see Google Research's paper and Meta's research).
   - **Traceability:**
      - Identification of which model made a decision about an individual and when.
   - **Explainability:**
      - Introduction of methods to make black-box models more explainable, including LIME, SHAP, counterfactual explanations, Deep Taylor Decomposition, etc.
      - Additional references to an overview of machine learning interpretability and a discussion on the pros and cons of explainable AI.
