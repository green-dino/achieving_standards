# Data Minimization and Storage Limitation

## 1. **Introduction**
   - Overview of the principle emphasizing the need to minimize personal information in training datasets.
   
## 2. **Guidelines for Implementation**
   - **Avoid Unnecessary Attributes:**
      - Do not collect or copy irrelevant attributes to the dataset.
   - **Anonymization:**
      - Anonymize data where possible; refer to WP 29 Guideline for nuanced guidance.
   - **Granularity Reduction:**
      - If full anonymization is not possible, reduce data granularity for aggregate insights.
   - **Use of Minimal Data:**
      - Use only the necessary amount of data; avoid unnecessary records (e.g., if 10k records suffice, do not use 1 million).
   - **Timely Deletion:**
      - Delete data as soon as it becomes irrelevant (e.g., data from 7 years ago).
   - **Link Removal:**
      - Remove links in the dataset by obfuscating user IDs, device identifiers, and other linkable attributes.
   - **Access Control:**
      - Limit data access to stakeholders on a "need to know" basis.

## 3. **Privacy-Preserving Techniques**
   - **Distributed Data Analysis:**
      - Exchange anonymous aggregated data to maintain privacy.
   - **Secure Multi-Party Computation:**
      - Store data in a distributed-encrypted manner for enhanced privacy.
