Fairness in handling personal data is crucial to building trust and preventing unjustified adverse effects. This document explores the concept of fairness, its significance in data processing, and key considerations outlined in GDPR Article 5.

Defining Fairness

Fairness, as per GDPR and EDPS guidelines, involves preventing "unjustifiably detrimental, unlawfully discriminatory, unexpected or misleading" processing of personal data. This section discusses the importance of fair processing and the absence of specific metrics in GDPR.

Implementing Fairness Measures

While GDPR doesn't prescribe specific fairness metrics, the EDPS recommends implementing measures such as transparency, access rights, erasure, data portability, rectification, and the right to limit processing. This section delves into these measures and their role in upholding the principle of fairness.

Assessing Fairness Metrics

This section introduces various fairness metrics found in the literature, including group fairness, false positive error rate, unawareness, and counterfactual fairness. The lack of an industry standard for selecting metrics is highlighted, emphasizing the importance of assessing fairness, especially in algorithms influencing significant decisions.

Industry Standards and Testing Efforts

Explore the absence of an industry-wide standard for fairness metrics and the ongoing efforts to test algorithms using diverse metrics. Reference initiatives such as NIST's FRVT project, which evaluates face recognition algorithms for fairness using different metrics.
