This playbook is designed to simplify getting started with computing systems and business processes. 

Here's an example of an approach to problem solving. 

This playbook has several components - 

[Diagram](./Diagrams/Learning.md) section contains visual diagrams of relationships that you will encounter when using computer systems. 

[Implementing AI](./ImplementingAI/Presentation.md), we discuss the considerations to managing and integrating Machine Learning and AI to improve your organization and protect users privacy. 

Under [Playbooks](./Playbooks/Getting_started.md) you'll find the building blocks and samples to get started with developing a playbook. 

The [Trouble Ticket](./TroubleTickets/Concept.md) explores how to create a trouble ticketing system that builds your site reliability functions, improves customer experience and resolves misconfigurations across the technical stack. 

| **Key Component**       | **Description**                                                                                                              |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Problem**             | A customer's request for complex permissions, initially estimated at six weeks, revealed an underlying issue: files were being archived without user awareness, affecting all users.    |
| **Solution**            | Instead of proceeding with the complex permissions, a more efficient approach was adopted. A warning system was implemented to inform users about the consequences of file archival, addressing the root problem and mitigating the need for a lengthy six-week project. |
| **Impact**              | The implemented solution resulted in a one-day change, significantly reducing the time and resources required. Users were now informed about archival impacts, enhancing awareness and avoiding the need for a complex permissions system. This approach optimized the resolution process and showcased the value of exploring alternative solutions. |
