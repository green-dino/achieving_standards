# Welcome to your playbook

This playbook is designed to simplify getting started with computing systems and business processes. 

Here's an example of an approach to problem solving. 

This playbook has several components - 

[Diagram](./Diagrams/Learning.md) section contains visual diagrams of relationships that you will encounter when using computer systems. 

[Implementing AI](./ImplementingAI/Presentation.md), we discuss the considerations to managing and integrating Machine Learning and AI to improve your organization and protect users privacy. 

Under [Playbooks](./Playbooks/Getting_started.md) you'll find the building blocks and samples to get started with developing a playbook. 

The [Trouble Ticket](./TroubleTickets/Concept.md) explores how to create a trouble ticketing system that builds your site reliability functions, improves customer experience and resolves misconfigurations across the technical stack. 

| **Key Component**       | **Description**                                                                                                              |

| **Problem**             | A customer's request for complex permissions, initially estimated at six weeks, revealed an underlying issue: files were being archived without user awareness, affecting all users.    |
| **Solution**            | Instead of proceeding with the complex permissions, a more efficient approach was adopted. A warning system was implemented to inform users about the consequences of file archival, addressing the root problem and mitigating the need for a lengthy six-week project. |
| **Impact**              | The implemented solution resulted in a one-day change, significantly reducing the time and resources required. Users were now informed about archival impacts, enhancing awareness and avoiding the need for a complex permissions system. This approach optimized the resolution process and showcased the value of exploring alternative solutions. |
