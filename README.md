# Overview

Welcome to the Problem Solving Logic Guidebook! This guide is designed to help you effectively address and resolve various challenges encountered in your projects. The logic presented here outlines the relationships between different types of issues and the corresponding steps to take for resolution. By following this structured approach, you can streamline your problem-solving process and ensure a comprehensive and efficient response to issues that may arise.

# Problem Solving Logic

The core of this guidebook revolves around a logical flow that connects different types of problems to their respective solutions. Here is a brief overview of the key relationships:

## Problem:
A generic issue that needs attention.
Can lead to different types of responses based on the nature of the problem.
## Change:
A response to a problem that involves making alterations to existing processes.
Consists of two phases:
Implementation: Executing the changes identified as necessary.
Validation: Verifying the effectiveness of the implemented changes.
## Incident:
A response to a problem that involves addressing unexpected events or disruptions.
Consists of two phases:
Investigation: Understanding the root cause and nature of the incident.
Resolution: Implementing measures to resolve the incident and prevent its recurrence.
## Request:
A response to a problem that involves fulfilling a specific need or requirement.
Consists of two phases:
## Evaluation: Assessing the nature and scope of the request.
## Fulfillment: Providing the necessary resources or actions to meet the request.
How to Use This Guidebook

## Identify the Problem Type:
Determine the nature of the issue you are facingâ€”whether it's a change, incident, or request.
## Follow the Corresponding Flow:
Once the problem type is identified, follow the logical flow to determine the necessary steps.
## Execute the Phases:
For each problem type, execute the relevant phases (e.g., Implementation and Validation for Change).
## Iterate as Needed:
Problem-solving is often an iterative process. If the issue persists or new problems arise, revisit the guide and adapt your approach.
